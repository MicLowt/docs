### Company

Spoon sandboxes run in isolated containers, allowing applications to run side-by-side without conflicts, dependencies, or modifications to the host desktop. Spoon.net's unique hybrid client/server virtualization technology combines the convenience of web-based delivery with the performance and robustness of local execution.

#### Partner with Spoon

Spoon technology is integrated into select third-party enterprise application delivery platforms, including [Novell ZENworks Suite](https://www.novell.com/products/zenworks/zenworks-suite/), [Novell ZENworks Application Virtualization](https://www.novell.com/products/zenworks/applicationvirtualization/), and [LANDesk Management Suite](http://landesk.com/).

To support our growth, we are currently enrolling partner companies into our Reseller Partner Program. This program offers solution providers the ability to enhance the value of their offerings with Spoon products and technologies.

If you are interested in working with Spoon, either formally or informally, please email [partners@spoon.net](mailto:partners@spoon.net) with a brief description of your company and how you would like to work with Spoon, as well as your name, title, and contact information.
