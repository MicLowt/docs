In this section you'll learn a variety of methods for managing and building containers and images with Spoon Studio and the command-line interface. You'll also learn how to integrate containerization with your continuous integration server.

## Working with Containers

### Creating Containers

The `spoon run` command starts new containers. You must specify a base image to provide the virtual filesystem and registry for the container. If no files or registry keys are necessary, use the empty clean image.

```
# Launch a command window in a new container with clean as the base image
> spoon run spoonbrew/clean
```

Operations executed in the new command window are applied to the container, not the host system.

To avoid confusion, the prompt is prepended by the first 8 characters of the container ID when a command window is running in a container.

```
# Host command window
> spoon run spoonbrew/clean

# Container command window
(8dpp9eb5) >
```

Edit and modify the container's virtual filesystem and registry using the same command-line interfaces available in Windows Command Prompt.

### Managing Containers

Once created, track and manage containers with these commands.

```
# List containers with base images, commands, creation date, and status
> spoon containers

ID           Images              Command       Created          Status
03bddd8bef   spoonbrew/clean   cmd           8/14/2014 1:03   Stopped
52hd888xa3   local/server-app    startup.bat   8/14/2014 1:00   Running

# Remove a specific container from the host system
> spoon rm 03bddd8bef

# Remove all containers
> spoon rm -a
```

Note that running containers must be stopped before being removed.

### Processes and Stopping Containers

The life cycle of a container is controlled by the processes within that container. Processes in a container spawn as child processes of the **Spoon VM** executable, which manages the container environment.

When a process within a container exits or completes, the container exits as well.

```
# You can forcefully exit a container from the native command window
> spoon stop <container id>
```

This command kills the **Spoon VM** managing process along with any child processes.

You can also explicitly shut down a container from a command window running in the container by typing `exit` or entering Ctrl+C.

```
# If necessary, restart a closed container and specify the container ID
> spoon start 8dpp9eb5
```

### Debugging

If you experience crashing or other issues with Spoon containers, here are several commands to help you debug and fix these problems.

```
# If your container unexpectedly crashes, enable diagnostic mode
> spoon run --diagnostic <image>

# Then fetch the logs created by the run
> spoon logs
```

This command returns logs of all the standard streams (`STDIN`, `STDOUT`, `STDERR`) for the specified container.

Please note that enabling diagnostic mode will cause your container to run slower than expected. Therefore we recommend only enabling this mode for diagnostic/debugging purposes.

```
# You can also debug by viewing changes to a container's filesystem and registry
> spoon diff 8dpp9eb5

# Similarly you can revert changes to get the container back to a running state or to debug changes
> spoon revert 8dpp9eb5
```

### Building Images from Containers

Once you're finished editing a container, it can be saved and distributed in the form of images. For more information on images, read on [here](/docs/building/working-with-images).

```
# Create a new image from a container, specify the container ID and a name for the new image
> spoon commit 52hd888xa3 test
```

By default, the `commit` command merges sandbox changes with the base images and builds a new image from these merged layers. Specifying the "--no-base" option builds a new image of the sandbox changes without merging the base images.
