Spoon's [Browser Sandbox](/browsers) makes cross-browser and backwards compatibility testing easy. Just click **Run** for any browser to launch it instantly.

Browsers run within isolated virtual containers, eliminating the need for installs and allowing legacy browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 to run on Windows 7 and 8.

Containerized browsers behave exactly like installed browsers, and because they run locally, you can test web applications hosted on your own development machine or on internal servers. Simply launch the browser from Spoon.net and enter your test URL in the navigation bar.

Spoon browsers support standard browser components like Java applets and ActiveX controls as well as popular browser plugins like Firebug, IE Developer Toolbar, and CSS and JavaScript debugging consoles.
